# ML_final_project
re-implementation of cycleGAN


CycleGAN re-implementation script is train_custom.py

Baseline implementation script is train_custom_no_cycle.py

plot_losses.py is a simple script to plot the generated loss text file

How to run: 

1. Download maps dataset from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c_t6EvIKxlGziE_663IBo36yVVb-2dus/view?usp=sharing
2. Unzip dataset
3. In train_custom.py, change "data_dir" to link to this dataset, as well as the "output_dir" for image and loss outputs
4. Adjust the other options as seen fit
5. run train_custom.py (same applies for the baseline)
